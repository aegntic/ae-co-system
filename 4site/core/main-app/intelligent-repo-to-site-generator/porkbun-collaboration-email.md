Hi Porkbun Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out as both a satisfied Porkbun customer and the founder of 4site.pro, an AI-powered platform that automatically transforms GitHub repositories into professional websites.

## About 4site.pro

We've built a unique platform that solves a critical problem for developers: **automated content creation**. Our websites don't just generate once - they automatically update themselves and create blog posts at development checkpoints, allowing developers to focus on building rather than creating "marketing noise."

Our user base consists entirely of developers, entrepreneurs, and technical teams - exactly Porkbun's target audience.

## Partnership Opportunity

I'd love to explore a collaboration that benefits both our communities:

### **What We're Proposing:**
- **Affiliate Partnership**: Seamless domain integration for our 50,000+ developer users
- **Developer-First Experience**: One-click domain connection through Porkbun's API
- **Mutual Value**: We drive high-quality developer customers; you provide the domains they need

### **Why This Makes Sense:**
- **Aligned Values**: Both companies prioritize developer experience and fair pricing
- **Quality Customers**: Our users are serious builders who value good service (like Porkbun's)
- **Natural Integration**: Websites need domains; developers need reliable, reasonably-priced providers
- **Non-Competing**: We complement each other perfectly without overlap

### **Current Integration Idea:**
- **Free Tier**: Users can connect any domain provider manually
- **Enhanced Experience**: $4.94 one-time tip unlocks direct Porkbun integration
- **Streamlined UX**: One-click domain setup through Porkbun's API
- **Revenue Share**: Standard affiliate terms that work for both parties

## Why I Choose Porkbun

As a current customer, I appreciate:
- **Transparent Pricing**: No hidden fees or upselling tactics
- **Developer-Friendly**: Great API, clear documentation
- **Fair Business Practices**: You treat customers with respect
- **Quality Service**: Reliable, fast, and responsive support

This is exactly the type of partner we want to work with for our developer community.

## Next Steps

Would you be interested in a brief call to discuss this opportunity? I'm happy to:
- Demo the 4site.pro platform
- Share our user growth metrics and demographics
- Discuss specific integration possibilities
- Explore partnership terms that work for both sides

I believe this could be a fantastic partnership that provides genuine value to developers while growing both our businesses.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
