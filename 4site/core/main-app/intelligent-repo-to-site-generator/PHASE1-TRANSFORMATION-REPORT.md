## ✅ TASK 1.2: MESSAGE ARCHITECTURE TRANSFORMATION

### ✅ **Apple-Esque Typography Hierarchy**
```typescript
export const TYPOGRAPHY_HIERARCHY = {
  hero_primary: "text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-light tracking-tight",
  hero_secondary: "text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-normal",
  anticipation_build: "text-lg md:text-xl font-medium",
  micro_copy: "text-sm font-normal opacity-80"
};
```

### ✅ **Psychological Messaging Framework**
```typescript
export const VALUE_PROPOSITIONS = {
  INSTANT_MAGIC: 'Transform any GitHub repository into a professional website in under 30 seconds',
  WOW_MOMENT: 'Watch your code become a stunning professional showcase instantly',
  ZERO_FRICTION: 'No signup, no complexity, no learning curve - just pure magic',
  FOCUS_TRIGGER: 'Get online instantly while learning to build digitally - focus on building, we handle everything else'
};
```

};
```

## ✅ TASK 1.3: PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK

### ✅ **State Management System**

DISCLOSURE_STATES = {
  INITIAL: 'initial',           // Show only FREE magic
  POST_GENERATION: 'post_generation',  // After successful generation
  POST_DEPLOYMENT: 'post_deployment',  // Trigger pricing reveal with 3s delay
  CONVERSION_READY: 'conversion_ready' // User psychologically ready
}
```

### ✅ **User Journey Tracking Framework**
```typescript
export const useUserJourney = () => {
  // Comprehensive analytics:
  // - Engagement score calculation
  // - Conversion probability analysis  
  // - A/B test assignment and tracking
  // - Scroll depth and exit intent monitoring
  // - Session duration and interaction patterns
}
```

### ✅ **A/B Testing Infrastructure**
```typescript
export const AB_TEST_VARIANTS = {
  MESSAGING: ['instant_magic', 'developer_focused', 'portfolio_builder'],
  CTA_STYLE: ['glass_primary', 'gradient_pulse', 'minimal_clean'],
  SUCCESS_FLOW: ['immediate_upsell', 'delayed_reveal', 'milestone_based']
};
```

### ✅ **Conversion Optimization Analytics**
