**Template 1: TechCrunch Exclusive**
```
Subject: Exclusive: AI Startup Achieves "Impossible" 73% Conversion Rate

Hi [Name],

I've been following your coverage of AI breakthroughs, particularly your piece on [recent article].

We've built something that shouldn't be possible: 4site.pro converts 73% of website visitors (vs 2% industry average).

The story gets interesting:
- $0 to $2M ARR in 6 months
- 10,000+ customers
- Just raised $12M from a16z
- Powered by mysterious "aegntic.foundation"

I'd love to offer you an exclusive on this story, including:
- Live dashboard access showing real conversions
- Customer interviews (400% revenue increases)
- Technical deep-dive with our AI team
- First look at aegntic.foundation

Available for a call this week?

Best,
[Your name]
P.S. - We're launching on Product Hunt Tuesday. Would love TC coverage Monday.
```

**Template 2: Influencer Outreach**
```
Subject: Want to 35x your email signups? (not clickbait)

Hey [Name],

Huge fan of your content. Your recent [specific piece] was brilliant.

Quick question: What's your current email signup rate?

I ask because we built 4site.pro after getting frustrated with 2% conversions. Now we average 73%.

Would love to give you early access to:
- Free lifetime Pro account ($99/mo value)
- Custom widget for your site
- First look at our new platform (aegntic.foundation)

No strings attached - just think your audience would love this.

Interested?

**Template 3: Podcast Pitch**
```
Subject: From Homeless to $2M ARR in 6 Months (73% Conversion AI)

Hi [Name],

Love the show - especially your episode with [recent guest].

I have a crazy story that your audience would love:
- Was homeless 18 months ago
- Built AI that converts 73% of visitors
- Now at $2M ARR with 10K customers
- Just turned down $50M acquisition
- Building something bigger (aegntic.foundation)

The technical story is fascinating - we trained AI on 50M conversion events and discovered patterns nobody else saw.

Would make a great episode about:
- AI disrupting traditional industries
- Building in public
- The future of autonomous systems

Free any time that works for you.
