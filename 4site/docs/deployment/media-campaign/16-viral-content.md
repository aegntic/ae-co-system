**Thread 1: "How we went from 2% to 73% conversion"**
```
1/ Everyone talks about traffic. Nobody talks about conversion.

We increased our conversion rate from 2% to 73%.

Here's exactly how we did it ðŸ§µ

2/ First, the problem:
- Average website converts at 2.3%
- That means 97.7% of your traffic is WASTED
- You're literally burning money

3/ We tried everything:
- A/B testing (got us to 4%)
- Better copy (maybe 5%)
- Faster site (5.5% max)

Still losing 94.5% of visitors.

4/ Then we discovered something...

Our AI could predict user behavior with 94% accuracy.
- Scroll patterns
- Mouse movements  
- Time on page
- Click sequences

5/ So we built 4site.pro:
- AI watches every visitor
- Optimizes in real-time
- Personalizes everything
- No coding required

6/ The results:
Week 1: 23% conversion
Week 2: 45% conversion
Week 3: 67% conversion
Week 4: 73% conversion (and holding)

7/ Our customers are seeing:
- 400% revenue increase
- 10x more leads
- 50% less ad spend
- ROI in 7 days

8/ But here's the crazy part...

This is powered by @aegntic_foundation

And 4site.pro is just the beginning.

9/ I can't say much about aegntic yet.

But imagine AI that builds AI.
Systems that improve themselves.
The future of automation.

Invitation only for now.

10/ Want 73% conversion?
