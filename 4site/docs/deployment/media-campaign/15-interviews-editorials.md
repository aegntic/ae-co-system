**Title**: "The Founder Interview: How 4site.pro Achieved 73% Conversion Rates"

**Q: You're claiming 73% conversion rates. That seems impossible.**
A: It does, doesn't it? When we started, we didn't believe it either. But when you combine behavioral AI, real-time optimization, and what we call "predictive personalization," you start to see patterns humans miss. Every visitor gets a uniquely optimized experience.

**Q: How does the AI actually work?**
A: Without revealing too much, we analyze hundreds of micro-interactions - scroll patterns, hesitation points, form field sequence. Our AI predicts intent and adjusts in real-time. It's powered by our parent platform, aegntic.foundation, which... well, I can't say much about that yet.

**Q: What is aegntic.foundation?**
A: [Laughs] I knew you'd ask. Let's just say 4site.pro is the tip of the iceberg. Aegntic is building autonomous AI systems that go far beyond websites. Think AI that can build, deploy, and improve itself. We're keeping it invitation-only for now.

**Q: Who's the target market?**
A: Any business losing money to poor conversion. E-commerce sites see 400% revenue increases. SaaS companies double their trial signups. We even have influencers using our lead capture widgets getting 10x more email subscribers.

**Q: What's next for 4site.pro?**
A: We're launching our Series A to scale globally. But honestly? Most of our engineering effort is going into aegntic.foundation. 4site.pro proves the technology works. Aegntic will change everything.
