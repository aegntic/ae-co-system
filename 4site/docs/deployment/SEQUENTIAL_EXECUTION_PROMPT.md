# Sequential Execution Prompt with Advanced Reasoning

## Master Execution Command

```
Execute the following deployment groups SEQUENTIALLY (complete each group before moving to the next), using ultraplan, ultrathink, and mcp__sequentialthinking__sequentialthinking in PARALLEL for maximum reasoning power:

## GROUP 3: Configuration (Execute FIRST)

Read and execute these prompts in PARALLEL from /home/tabs/project4site/ultraplan-launch/:
- 07-dns-domain.md
- 08-github-oauth.md
- 09-security-config.md

Use all three reasoning tools in parallel to:
1. Analyze optimal DNS configuration for maximum performance
2. Design secure OAuth flow with proper error handling
3. Implement comprehensive security hardening

Create all specified output files with placeholder values.
After completion, create GROUP3_CONFIGURATION_SUMMARY.md

## GROUP 4: Launch Preparation (Execute AFTER Group 3 completes)

Read and execute these prompts SEQUENTIALLY from /home/tabs/project4site/ultraplan-launch/:
1. First: 10-pre-launch-test.md
2. Then: 11-monitoring-setup.md
3. Finally: 12-launch-checklist.md

Use all three reasoning tools in parallel to:
1. Design comprehensive test suites covering all edge cases
2. Create monitoring dashboards for instant issue detection
3. Build foolproof launch checklist with rollback procedures

Create all specified output files and scripts.
After completion, create GROUP4_LAUNCH_SUMMARY.md

## GROUP 5: Media Campaign (Execute AFTER Group 4 completes)

Read and execute ALL prompts in PARALLEL from /home/tabs/project4site/ultraplan-launch/media-campaign/:
- 13-press-releases.md
- 14-media-assets.md
- 15-interviews-editorials.md
- 16-viral-content.md
- 17-distribution-outreach.md

Use all three reasoning tools in parallel to:
1. Craft viral hooks that guarantee 1M+ impressions
2. Design media assets that convert viewers to users
3. Create distribution strategy for maximum reach

Create complete media kit in /home/tabs/project4site/media-kit/
After completion, create MEDIA_CAMPAIGN_SUMMARY.md

## Final Summary

After ALL groups complete, create COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md containing:
- All files created across all groups
- All placeholder values that need real data
- Complete launch checklist
- Media distribution timeline
- Success metrics and KPIs

## Critical Requirements

1. Use ultraplan + ultrathink + sequential thinking IN PARALLEL for each task
2. Complete each group FULLY before moving to the next
3. Create ALL specified files with proper structure
4. Use placeholder values (YOUR-VALUE-HERE) for sensitive data
5. Make all scripts executable with proper shebang lines
6. Include comprehensive error handling in all code
7. Document every decision and configuration

## Success Criteria

- Group 3: Production environment fully configured
- Group 4: All systems tested and monitored
- Group 5: Complete media kit ready for viral launch
- All documentation complete and actionable
- Zero blockers for production launch
```

## Reasoning Tool Guidelines

When using the three reasoning tools in parallel:

### ultraplan
- Focus on strategic planning and architecture
- Design optimal system configurations
- Plan rollback and contingency strategies
- Create detailed implementation roadmaps

### ultrathink
- Analyze complex problems from multiple angles
- Consider edge cases and failure modes
- Optimize for performance and scalability
- Think through security implications

### mcp__sequentialthinking__sequentialthinking
- Break down complex tasks into steps
- Maintain context across related tasks
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Build comprehensive solutions iteratively

## Expected Timeline

- Group 3: 30 minutes (parallel execution)
- Group 4: 45 minutes (sequential execution)
- Group 5: 30 minutes (parallel execution)
- Total: ~2 hours for complete deployment

## Verification Steps

After each group:
1. Verify all files created
2. Check for any missing configurations
3. Validate placeholder values are clearly marked
4. Ensure documentation is complete
5. Test any created scripts for syntax errors
