# UltraPlan Launch Strategy for 4site.pro

## Overview
This directory contains step-by-step prompts to deploy and launch 4site.pro to production. Following the successful bug fix, these prompts guide the complete production deployment process.

## Execution Strategy
These prompts are designed for **parallel execution** where possible. Each prompt is self-contained with clear dependencies marked.

### Parallel Groups
Execute prompts within each group in parallel, then wait for completion before moving to the next group:

**Group 1 - Environment Setup (Execute in parallel)**
- `01-production-env.md` - Configure production environment variables
- `02-api-keys-setup.md` - Set up all API keys and services
- `03-database-setup.md` - Configure Supabase production database

**Group 2 - Build & Deploy (Execute in parallel)**
- `04-frontend-deploy.md` - Build and deploy React frontend
- `05-backend-deploy.md` - Deploy Express API server
- `06-cdn-assets.md` - Set up CDN and static assets

**Group 3 - Configuration (Execute in parallel)**
- `07-dns-domain.md` - Configure DNS and domain settings
- `08-github-oauth.md` - Set up GitHub OAuth for production
- `09-security-config.md` - Implement security measures

**Group 4 - Launch Preparation (Execute sequentially)**
- `10-pre-launch-test.md` - Comprehensive pre-launch testing
- `11-monitoring-setup.md` - Set up monitoring and analytics
- `12-launch-checklist.md` - Final launch checklist and go-live

## Current State
The application has been fixed and tested locally:
- ✅ Core bug resolved (generateSiteContentFromUrl returns SiteData)
- ✅ Repository-specific content generation working
- ✅ UI preview functionality implemented
- ✅ All tests passing

## Launch Goals
1. Deploy 4site.pro to production environment
2. Enable GitHub OAuth authentication
3. Configure lead capture and analytics
4. Set up monitoring and error tracking
5. Launch marketing campaign
6. Monitor initial user adoption

## Expected Outcome
After executing all prompts:
- 4site.pro live at https://4site.pro
- API running at https://api.4site.pro
- GitHub OAuth fully functional
- Lead capture widget distributable
- Analytics dashboard operational
- Production monitoring active

## Critical Success Factors
- Zero downtime deployment
- Secure API keys and credentials
- Scalable infrastructure
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated backups
- GDPR compliance

## File Naming Convention
Each prompt produces files with clear labels:
- Configuration: `*-config.json`
- Environment: `*.env`
- Scripts: `*-deploy.sh`
- Documentation: `*-guide.md`
- Monitoring: `*-dashboard.json`
