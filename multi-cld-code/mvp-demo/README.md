# CCTM MVP Demo - The Starting Point

This directory contains a simplified version of the original MVP that started the CCTM journey - showing how the revolutionary idea began as a simple terminal manager and evolved into the world's first multi-instance Claude Code workflow system.

## MVP Vision (Original Concept)

The MVP started with a simple but powerful idea:
> "What if we could manage multiple terminal sessions without constantly switching tabs and losing track of what's running where?"

## MVP Features

### Basic Terminal Management
- Simple terminal creation and management
- Basic session tracking
- Rudimentary attention detection
- Simple UI for multiple terminals

### Core Problem Solved
Before CCTM, developers had to:
- ❌ Manually switch between terminal tabs/windows
- ❌ Remember which terminals were running what commands
- ❌ Lose context when working on multiple projects
- ❌ Manually check if processes were still running

### MVP Solution
- ✅ Single interface for multiple terminals
- ✅ Basic status indicators
- ✅ Simple session management
- ✅ Foundation for attention detection

## Evolution to Full CCTM

The MVP evolved through several key phases:

### Phase 1: Basic Terminal Pool
- Virtual terminal instances
- Simple resource management
- Basic UI components

### Phase 2A: Advanced Virtualization
- 50+ concurrent terminals
- Resource monitoring and optimization
- Advanced attention detection

### Phase 2B: Intelligence Layer
- File system monitoring
- Project detection (Rust, TS, Python, Go)
- Context awareness

### Phase 2C: AI Integration
- MCP server discovery and integration
- Natural language commands
- **Phase 2C.4**: Revolutionary conversational AI bridge

## Files in this Demo

```

## Key Insights from MVP

1. **Multi-terminal management** was immediately valuable
2. **Attention detection** was crucial for workflow efficiency  
3. **Session persistence** became essential for complex projects
4. **Resource optimization** was needed for scaling
5. **AI integration** transformed it from tool to assistant

## MVP → Full CCTM Evolution

| MVP | Full CCTM |
|-----|-----------|
| Basic terminal tabs | 100+ concurrent virtualized terminals |
| Simple status checking | Real-time AI-powered attention detection |
| Manual command entry | Natural language AI commands |
| Single project focus | Multi-project context awareness |
| Local terminals only | MCP server ecosystem integration |
