Find the right idea/trend
Sketch out the idea
Scope out the MVP
Vibe coding your prototype
Vibe marketing the business
“Watch me as I replace a developer, salesperson, designer,
marketer, researcher, product manager… with AI agents.”
- Mattae Cooper

Step 1. Find the right idea/trend
Tool: ideabrowser.com → AI-powered business idea generator

Idea: Build an AI SEO Agency called LLMBoost
Why: 5-10% of organic search now happens on large
language models (LLMs). People are finding businesses
and signing up via ChatGPT.

Step 1. Find the right idea/trend
The website not only shows you the idea, but also breaks down:

Whether people are talking about
this topic online…

How much money you can make…

How you should go to market…

Step 1. Find the right idea/trend
Whether you’re the best person to build this business…

“If you have a proven track record of execution,
or if going forward is not a problem for you,
then ideas are actually incredibly important.”
- Sam Parr

Step 2. Sketch out your idea
Tool: tldraw → a whiteboard tool similar to Figjam
Sketch out a flowchart of the overall experience of LLM Boost. You don’t have to be a designer — anyone can make boxes!

Hot Tip: You’ll get better results from an LLM if you give it a diagram or flowchart like this.

Step 3. Scope out the MVP
Tool: Manus → a general AI agent that Greg describes as “a supercharged version of OpenAI’s Operator”

●

Popularity shot up when it launched in March this year

●

17.8M site visits per month

●

Developed by China

“It’s like having 100 agents working for you.”
- Greg

Source: Google Trends

Step 3. Scope out the MVP
Greg’s Prompt

Hot Tips:
●

Use Wispr Flow to prompt by voice instead of
typing

●

Tell Manus (or any LLM) to “ask me anything
before you get started.” It gets you better
outputs.

●

Ask AI to pretend they’re someone you look up
to. Then ask questions like “how would [insert
name] start this business?”

Step 3. Scope out the MVP
Manus created an entire project plan — the way a product manager does. Then it drafted quiz questions.

Step 3. Scope out the MVP
Greg downloaded a LLM SEO mini course
from thevibemarketer.com to help shorten
and refine the quiz questions.

Improved results

Hot Tip: Ask the LLM what’s the best prompt to use.
You will never be able to out-prompt the software
that sees all the prompts.

Step 4. Vibe code the prototype
Tool: Bolt.new → an AI web development agent

Manus gave a suuper long
prompt that’ll take humans
HOURS to write.
Feed that into Bolt, and
you get…

A sleek, functional landing page

Step 4. Vibe code the prototype
●

Now you have a working interface/frontend

●

To get the actual quiz results, you need a
ChatGPT API key

●

In < 1 hour, you can have ChatGPT analyze
the data, then feed its output into a
database tool (Supabase) via an integration

Step 5. Vibe market your business
Tool: Lindy → A no-code platform that lets you build AI assistants (agents)

“I don’t know why more people don’t do this, but there are
thousands of $1M+ ideas just by using Lindy’s and
Gumloop’s workflows, and selling them into the real world.”
- Greg

Lindy has many ready-to-use workflow templates

Step 5. Vibe market your business
Example 1: The prospecting workflow for Late Checkout Agency, Greg’s design firm targeting VP+ executives.

●

Greg shares thought leadership posts on LinkedIn

●

If a VP+ level person likes or comments on the post, the
AI agent pulls their social data to see if they’re a qualified
lead

●

If qualified, the agent gets their email and phone number
(need a paid Prospect account)

●

A dedicated Slack channel alerts the sales team

●

If a salesperson posts a ❤emoji in that slack channel, it
sends a personalized email or text message to the
prospect

Step 5. Vibe market your business
Example 2: AI negotiator workflow

●

If someone contacts you for a discount, this
AI agent can email them and negotiate the
terms, following the prompt below:

Step 5. Vibe market your business
Example 3: AI voice agent for customer feedback

●

Create a 1-800 number

●

People call the number, AI agent asks for their
feedback

●

Stores the feedback in a database (Airtable)

●

Summarizes the call and let the team know

Result: you save massive amount of time and $$$
●

Using AI agents, Greg has gone from 120 employees to under 60, saving
$5M per year

●

“We're doing things at a speed and scale that we wouldn't be able to do with
human beings.”

“It's so important that you reach out to someone like 5,10,20 minutes after they engaged, or else
they might forget about you.”
- Greg

“Listen, I'm not saying it's as easy as 1-2-3-4-5-6. Building a startup is hard.
It's a rollercoaster. But this is the framework for how to build it, and you can
build it using tools like this. The unfair advantage and the returns you’re gonna
get by understanding these tools… it’s just worth it.”
