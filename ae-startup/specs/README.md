## Usage Guidelines

### Creating Specifications
1. **Start with the problem**: Clearly define what you're solving
2. **Be specific**: Use measurable criteria and concrete examples
3. **Include rationale**: Explain why decisions were made
4. **Plan for testing**: Define how success will be measured
5. **Consider edge cases**: Think through error conditions and boundaries

### Maintaining Specifications
- Update specifications when requirements change
- Archive obsolete specifications with clear deprecation notes
- Link related specifications to maintain traceability
- Review specifications during retrospectives

### AI Integration
These specifications are designed to be consumed by AI assistants to:
- Understand project requirements and constraints
- Generate implementation plans
- Validate proposed solutions against requirements
- Maintain consistency across development sessions

## Quality Standards

All specifications must meet the ae-co-system quality standards:
- **Performance**: Include specific performance requirements
- **Security**: Address security considerations
- **Privacy**: Ensure GDPR/SOC2/HIPAA compliance where applicable
- **Scalability**: Plan for growth and scale requirements
- **Maintainability**: Consider long-term maintenance and updates

This specification system ensures that all development work is well-planned, documented, and aligned with project objectives.
