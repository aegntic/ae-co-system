# AI Documentation (Persistent Knowledge)

This directory stores persistent AI knowledge that should be retained across sessions. This follows the TOP 1% AI coding patterns from the ae-co-system.

## Purpose

The `ai_docs/` folder maintains institutional knowledge that helps AI assistants provide better, more consistent support across development sessions.

## Structure

### Core Categories

#### API Documentation (`api-docs/`)
- Third-party API documentation and implementation notes
- Custom API specifications and integration guides
- Authentication patterns and security considerations
- Rate limiting and error handling strategies

#### Best Practices (`best-practices/`)
- Coding patterns discovered during development
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security implementation guidelines
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

#### Integration Guides (`integrations/`)
- Step-by-step integration procedures
- Troubleshooting solutions for common issues
- Configuration templates and examples
- Dependency management strategies

#### Workflow Documentation (`workflows/`)
- Custom development workflows
- Deployment procedures and checklists
- Testing strategies and methodologies
- Quality assurance processes

## Usage Guidelines

### What to Document
- **Complex integrations** that took significant time to implement
- **Non-obvious solutions** to common problems
- **Performance insights** discovered through profiling
- **Security patterns** that ensure compliance
- **Architecture decisions** and their rationale

### What NOT to Document
- Basic language syntax or framework basics
- Information easily found in official documentation
- Temporary workarounds or one-time fixes
- Personal preferences without technical justification

## Maintenance

- Review and update documentation quarterly
- Remove outdated information when dependencies change
- Keep examples current with latest versions
- Validate code snippets during major updates

## Integration with AI Development

This documentation is designed to be consumed by AI assistants to:
- Provide consistent architectural guidance
- Suggest proven patterns and solutions
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Maintain coding standards across sessions

## Templates

When creating new documentation, use these templates:

### API Integration Template
```markdown
# [Service Name] Integration

## Overview
Brief description of the service and integration purpose.

## Authentication
- Method: [API Key/OAuth/JWT]
- Setup: [Configuration steps]
- Security: [Best practices]

## Key Endpoints
- [Endpoint]: [Purpose and usage]
- [Endpoint]: [Purpose and usage]

## Error Handling
- [Error Type]: [Solution]
- [Error Type]: [Solution]

## Code Examples
[Working code snippets]

## Troubleshooting
[Common issues and solutions]
```

### Best Practice Template
```markdown
# [Pattern Name] Best Practice

## Problem
[What issue does this solve?]

## Solution
[Recommended approach]

## Implementation
[Code examples and steps]

## Benefits
[Why this approach is preferred]

## Considerations
[Trade-offs and limitations]

## Related Patterns
[Links to related documentation]
```

This documentation system ensures that knowledge gained during development is preserved and can be leveraged by future AI assistants working on the project.
