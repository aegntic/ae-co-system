STEP 5: VIBE MARKET YOUR BUSINESS
=================================

TOOL: Lindy
- A no-code platform that lets you build AI assistants (agents)
- Has many ready-to-use workflow templates

MATTAE'S INSIGHT:
"I don't know why more people don't do this, but there are thousands of $1M+ ideas just by using Lindy's and Gumloop's workflows, and selling them into the real world."

EXAMPLE 1: PROSPECTING WORKFLOW (Late Checkout Agency)
- Greg shares thought leadership posts on LinkedIn
- If a VP+ level person likes or comments, AI agent pulls their social data to see if they're qualified
- If qualified, agent gets their email and phone number (need paid Prospect account)
- Dedicated Slack channel alerts the sales team
- If salesperson posts ❤️ emoji in Slack, it sends personalized email or text to prospect

EXAMPLE 2: AI NEGOTIATOR WORKFLOW
- If someone contacts you for a discount, AI agent emails them and negotiates terms
- Follows predefined prompts and rules
- NOTE: Original document references "the prompt below" but specific negotiation prompt didn't convert properly from PDF

EXAMPLE 3: AI VOICE AGENT FOR CUSTOMER FEEDBACK
- Create a 1-800 number
- People call, AI agent asks for feedback
- Stores feedback in database (Airtable)
- Summarizes the call and alerts the team

RESULTS:
- Using AI agents, Greg went from 120 employees to under 60, saving $5M per year
- "We're doing things at a speed and scale that we wouldn't be able to do with human beings."

KEY TIMING INSIGHT:
"It's so important that you reach out to someone like 5,10,20 minutes after they engaged, or else they might forget about you." - Greg
