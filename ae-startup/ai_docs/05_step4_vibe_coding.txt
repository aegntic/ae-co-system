STEP 4: VIBE CODE THE PROTOTYPE
==============================

TOOL: Bolt.new
- AI web development agent

PROCESS:
- Manus gave a super long prompt that would take humans HOURS to write
- Feed that into Bolt.new
- Result: A sleek, functional landing page

WHAT YOU GET:
- Now you have a working interface/frontend
- To get the actual quiz results, you need a ChatGPT API key
- In < 1 hour, you can have ChatGPT analyze the data, then feed its output into a database tool (Supabase) via an integration

KEY ADVANTAGE:
AI can generate complex, detailed prompts that would be extremely time-consuming for humans to write, leading to better development outcomes.
