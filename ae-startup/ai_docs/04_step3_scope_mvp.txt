STEP 3: SCOPE OUT THE MVP
========================

TOOL: Manus
- A general AI agent that Greg describes as "a supercharged version of OpenAI's Operator"

- Popularity shot up when it launched in March (Source: Google Trends)
- 17.8M site visits per month
- Developed by China

NOTE: Mattae's specific prompt is referenced in the original but didn't convert properly from PDF - likely contained detailed instructions for the LLM SEO agency project plan.

MATTAE'S HOT TIPS:
1. Use Wispr Flow to prompt by voice instead of typing
2. Tell Manus (or any LLM) to "ask me anything before you get started." It gets you better outputs.
3. Ask AI to pretend they're someone you look up to. Then ask questions like "how would [insert name] start this business?"
4. Ask the LLM what's the best prompt to use. You will never be able to out-prompt the software that sees all the prompts.

RESULTS:
- Manus created an entire project plan â€” the way a product manager does
- Then it drafted quiz questions
- Greg downloaded a LLM SEO mini course from thevibemarketer.com to help shorten and refine the quiz questions
- Improved results through iterative refinement
