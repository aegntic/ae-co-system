# E2E-AUTO-MICRO-APPS: Linux-Based AI Project Auto-Initiation System
# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Version 1.0 | May 5, 2025

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

E2E-AUTO-MICRO-APPS is an end-to-end automated system for discovering, validating, and bootstrapping high-ROI micro-application projects. The system leverages AI capabilities to transform trending topics into fully-scaffolded development environments with minimal human intervention. By automating the ideation-to-implementation pipeline, developers can focus on building valuable solutions rather than repetitive setup tasks.

The system operates primarily on Linux environments, using a combination of Python, Bash, and Node.js components to orchestrate various AI models and development tools. It emphasizes cost efficiency by utilizing OpenRouter for model access, offline capabilities through caching mechanisms, and productivity through integrations with tools like Claude Desktop, GitHub, Context7, Shippie, Task-Master-AI, and n8n.
