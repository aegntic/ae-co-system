# Firebase Studio MCP Server - Setup Complete

## What's Been Done

The Firebase Studio MCP server has been successfully installed and configured:

1. **Node.js Version Upgrade**: Node.js v20.11.1 has been installed to meet Firebase CLI requirements
2. **Firebase CLI Installation**: Firebase CLI v14.2.0 has been installed globally
3. **Google Cloud SDK Installation**: Google Cloud SDK 465.0.0 has been installed
4. **MCP Server Fix**: The mcp-server module has been properly implemented with Express
5. **Authentication Capabilities**: Added Firebase and Google Cloud authentication methods
6. **Path Configuration**: Created startup scripts with proper PATH settings
7. **Dependency Resolution**: Fixed missing dependencies

## Available Methods

The server now provides the following methods:

- `initializeFirebase`: Initialize Firebase Admin SDK with service account
- `firebaseCommand`: Execute any Firebase CLI command directly
- `listProjects`: List all Firebase projects
- `gcloudCommand`: Execute any Google Cloud CLI command
- `startEmulators`: Start Firebase emulators
- `loginFirebase`: Login to Firebase CLI (added)
- `logoutFirebase`: Logout from Firebase CLI (added)
- `getCurrentUser`: Get current Firebase user (added)
- `loginGcloud`: Login to Google Cloud SDK (added)

## How to Start the Server

Run the script:

```bash
~/mcp-servers/firebase-studio-mcp/servers/firebase-studio-mcp/start-firebase-studio.sh
```

The server will start on port 3001 (or another port if 3001 is in use).

## Authentication with Firebase

Before using Firebase commands, you need to authenticate:

1. Use the `loginFirebase` method
2. Follow the authentication prompts
3. Once authenticated, your session will be saved

## Using with Claude

To interact with the server from Claude:

1. Start the server as shown above
2. In Claude, connect to the server at: `http://localhost:3001`

## Environment Setup

The following components have been installed:

- Node.js v20.11.1 at `/usr/local/lib/nodejs/bin`
- Google Cloud SDK at `~/google-cloud-sdk-install/google-cloud-sdk/bin`
- Firebase CLI globally available

The PATH has been configured to include these directories.

## Next Steps

1. Authenticate with Firebase using `loginFirebase`
2. Create or connect to Firebase projects using `listProjects` and related commands
3. Start using Firebase features through the MCP server
