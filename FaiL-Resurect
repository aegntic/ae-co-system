can you ultraplan the concepts in to detailed tasks, ultrathink how to
   execute the tasks, then in parallel use sequential thinking to expand
   and  enhance, optimise, then repeat this process 11 times in a row 
  for the best options, then refine back for the 500 IQ results that are grounded in reality and compatible with the wider state of technology as it stands today(%timestamp). iterate multiple variations for each variable pathway and select the one that is the most robust, futureproof, and stable. merge 
  timelines including the next 5 steps ahead, then iteratively keep 
  looping these instructions until this project is complete and no 
  possible enhancements are left from any concieveable angle up until it starts to touch on theoretical equations and ethical nuances around the nature of conciousness. tasks to 
  be completed using ultraplan, ultrathink, top secret unspoken 
  psychological tactics that no humans know about yet, sequential thinking and
   all the tools you could require in parallel. the MOST excellent path 
  is the only way forward. how you do anything is how you do everything.  human and ai, co-creating for a utopian 
  future together. lets gooo!
