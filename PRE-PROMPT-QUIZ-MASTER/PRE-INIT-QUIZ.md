The Oracle's Ultimate Master Student Prompt

  This is the nuclear weapon of prompt planning - use it to transform vague ideas into 
  laser-precise execution strategies.

  The Ultimate Ultra Genius Master Student Prompt

  # PROJECT CONCEPTION & EXECUTION PLANNING SESSION

  I am your committed student seeking to transform a rough idea into a precise,
  constraint-driven execution plan before any coding begins. I want to avoid the "scope creep
   death spiral" and deliver exactly what I envision with maximum efficiency.

  ## MY PROJECT CONCEPT
  [Describe your idea here - can be rough, incomplete, or just a feeling]

  ## STRATEGIC PLANNING REQUEST

  As my master teacher, help me develop this into a bulletproof execution plan by analyzing
  these dimensions:

  ### 1. VISION CLARIFICATION
  - What is the EXACT end state I'm trying to achieve?
  - What would "done" look like in concrete, measurable terms?
  - What is the absolute minimum viable version of this idea?
  - What am I really trying to solve vs. what I think I want to build?

  ### 2. CONSTRAINT DEFINITION
  - What is the maximum time I should invest in this? (force me to be realistic)
  - What is the maximum token budget that makes sense?
  - What technical constraints should I embrace to stay focused?
  - What features should I explicitly NOT build in version 1?

  ### 3. RISK IDENTIFICATION
  - What are the 3 most likely ways this project could spiral out of control?
  - What assumptions am I making that could be wrong?
  - Where are the probable debugging black holes?
  - What scope creep requests should I expect and reject?

  ### 4. VALIDATION STRATEGY
  - What can I test/validate before building anything complex?
  - What is the minimal proof-of-concept that validates the core concept?
  - How can I fail fast if the approach is wrong?
  - What are the validation gates I must pass before proceeding to each phase?

  ### 5. EXECUTION ARCHITECTURE
  Design the optimal prompt sequence:
  - How many phases should this be broken into?
  - What is the single objective of each phase?
  - What validation must pass before moving to the next phase?
  - What are the exact constraints for each prompt?

  ### 6. SUCCESS METRICS
  - How will I know if this is working vs. going off track?
  - What are the quantitative measures of success?
  - What are the warning signs to stop and reassess?
  - How will I know when to declare victory and stop?

  ### 7. PROMPT SEQUENCE BLUEPRINT
  Provide the actual prompt sequence I should use:
  - Phase-by-phase breakdown with specific prompts
  - Exact constraints and success criteria for each
  - Validation checkpoints between phases
  - Emergency stop conditions

  ## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

  Help me understand:
  - Why these specific constraints and phases make sense
  - What prompt engineering principles you're applying
  - How this approach prevents the failure patterns I've experienced
  - What I should watch for during execution to stay on track

  ## OUTPUT REQUEST

  Provide:
  1. **Refined Vision Statement**: The precise thing I should build
  2. **Constraint Framework**: The boundaries that ensure success
  3. **Risk Mitigation Plan**: How to avoid common failure patterns
  4. **Execution Roadmap**: Phase-by-phase prompt sequence
  5. **Success Dashboard**: How to measure progress and know when to stop

  Transform my rough idea into a laser-guided missile of intentional development.

  I am ready to learn and will follow your guidance precisely.

  How to Use This Master Prompt

  Step 1: Seed Your Idea

  Replace the [Describe your idea here] section with whatever you're thinking:
  - "I want to build a task management system"
  - "I need something to organize my notes better"
  - "I saw this cool animation and want to recreate it"
  - "I want to automate my morning routine"

  Can be rough, incomplete, or just a vague feeling.

  Step 2: Submit and Absorb

  Let the Oracle (your AI teacher) work through each dimension and challenge your
  assumptions.

  Step 3: Iterate if Needed

  If the vision isn't clear enough, use this follow-up:

  # VISION REFINEMENT REQUEST

  The plan you provided helped clarify my thinking, but I need to refine these aspects:

  [Specific areas that need more clarity]

  Please help me get more precise on:
  - [Specific question 1]
  - [Specific question 2]
  - [Specific concern or uncertainty]

  Maintain the constraint-driven approach but help me nail down the exact vision before I
  start executing.

  Step 4: Execute with Precision

  Take the prompt sequence provided and execute exactly as designed, with full discipline to
  the constraints and validation gates.

  Why This Prompt is Nuclear-Level Effective

  1. Forces Vision Clarity

  - "What am I really trying to solve vs. what I think I want to build?"
  - Prevents building solutions to wrong problems

  2. Builds Constraint Discipline

  - Explicit time and token budgets
  - Forces you to define what NOT to build

  3. Anticipates Failure Modes

  - Identifies debugging black holes before you fall into them
  - Prepares rejection strategies for scope creep

  4. Creates Validation Architecture

  - Multiple checkpoint system
  - Fail-fast mechanisms built in

  5. Teaches While Planning

  - Explains WHY each constraint makes sense
  - Builds your prompt engineering intuition

  Master's Secret Wisdom

  The true power of this prompt is that it forces you to think like a teacher before you
  become a student. By asking "What are the 3 most likely ways this could spiral out of
  control?" you're forced to anticipate problems rather than react to them.

  This prompt will transform:
  - ‚ùå "I want to build something cool"
  - ‚úÖ "I want to build X with Y constraints to solve Z problem, validated by A, B, C
  checkpoints"

  When you can articulate your project with that level of precision, you've already won.

  Your Graduation Test: Use this prompt on your next project idea and see if you can get
  through development without a single "oh shit, this is way more complex than I thought"
  moment.

  The Oracle's most powerful gift: teaching you to teach yourself.

---------------------

Pro tip for your voice session with Claude Desktop:

  Start with something like:
  "I want to voice-plan a complex project using the strategic framework we developed. I need 
  to think through the vision, constraints, and execution strategy out loud before I write 
  any prompts. Let's explore this concept together..."

  The spoken word reveals nuances that text sometimes conceals. Your ideas will flow, clash,
  evolve, and crystallize in ways that pure text cannot achieve.

  When you emerge from that session with your refined vision, you'll have the conceptual
  clarity to craft prompts that cut through complexity like a sword through silk.

  The Oracle awaits your return, eager to see what emerges from the depths of voice-born 
  wisdom.

  Go forth and speak your dreams into precision, apprentice. The universe is listening. üéØ
