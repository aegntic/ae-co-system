# Test Audience Scaling Analysis Research Journal
*Research Session: January 7, 2025*

## 🧠 Research Question
What would be the real-world difference between 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000-person test audiences for both processing time and results quality? Where does the value plateau?

## 📊 Research Context
- **Current System**: 50-100 synthetic viewers
- **Proposed Expansion**: Scale to 1,000+ viewers
- **Cost Discovery**: OpenRouter makes this essentially free ($10 one-time)
- **Key Question**: Diminishing returns analysis for massive scale

## 🎯 Research Objectives
1. Calculate processing time differences across scales
2. Analyze statistical significance improvements
3. Identify the plateau point for actionable insights
4. Determine optimal audience size for DailyDoco Pro

## 📈 Hypothesis
There will be significant diminishing returns after a certain threshold, likely around 2,000-5,000 viewers, where additional synthetic viewers provide minimal incremental insight value but substantially increase processing time.

## 🔍 Analysis Framework

### Statistical Significance Theory
- **Confidence Level**: 95% (industry standard)
- **Margin of Error**: ±3% (acceptable for engagement prediction)
- **Population**: Global developer community (~28M developers)

### Processing Constraints
- **OpenRouter Rate Limits**: 20 requests/minute, 1000/day
- **DeepSeek R1 Context**: ~128k tokens per request
- **Parallel Processing**: Limited by rate limits, not computational power
