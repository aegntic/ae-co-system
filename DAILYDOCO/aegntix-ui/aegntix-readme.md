# AgentiX - Orchestrated Reality Sandbox 🎭

> **"What if you could pause reality, whisper new information to the actors, and watch how the future changes?"**

AgentiX is a revolutionary AI orchestration platform that transforms how humans interact with AI agents. Instead of simple chat interfaces, we create living scenarios where multiple AI agents interact, and you control time itself.

## 🌟 The Vision

Traditional AI: Question → Answer → Done

AgentiX: Scenario → Pause → Intervene → Branch → Explore → Understand

We're building a platform where:
- **AI agents are actors** in scenarios you direct
- **Time is malleable** - pause, rewind, branch at will
- **Context is power** - inject information to change outcomes
- **Understanding emerges** from watching interactions

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install Bun (if needed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentix
cd agentix

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the development server
bun run dev

# Open your browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! No build step, no configuration hell. Just pure, fast development.

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🎬 Living Scenarios
Create multi-agent scenarios that unfold in real-time. Each agent has:
- Unique personality and goals
- Memory of past interactions
- Consistent behavior patterns
- Dynamic response to context changes

### ⏸️ Timeline Control
Revolutionary timeline manipulation features:
- **Pause**: Freeze any scenario mid-conversation
- **Resume**: Continue from any point
- **Branch**: Create alternate timelines to explore "what if"
- **Rewind**: Go back to any previous state
- **Compare**: See how different interventions lead to different outcomes

### 💉 Context Injection
While paused, inject new information:
- "A competitor just raised $50M"
- "New regulations were announced"
- "The market crashed"
- Watch how agents adapt their strategies

### 🚀 Blazing Performance
Built with Bun for unprecedented speed:
- Agent decisions in < 50ms
- Handle 1000+ simultaneous agents
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Zero build time

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) - Incredibly fast JavaScript runtime
- **Database**: SQLite (built into Bun) - Zero-config persistence
- **AI Models**: OpenRouter - Access to 100+ models
- **Protocols**: WebSockets - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS (upgradeable to React/Solid/Svelte)

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Basic Scenario Creation

```javascript
const scenario = await scenarioEngine.createScenario({
  name: "Product Launch",
  agents: [
    {
      role: "Product Manager",
      personality: "Optimistic but data-driven",
      goals: ["Launch on time", "Hit KPIs"]
    },
    {
      role: "Engineer",
      personality: "Cautious about technical debt",
      goals: ["Maintain code quality", "Realistic timelines"]
    }
  ],
  worldState: {
    deadline: "Q2 2024",
    budget: "$500k",
    teamSize: 5
  }
});
```

### Pausing and Injecting Context

```javascript
// Pause the scenario
await scenarioEngine.pause(scenarioId);

// Inject new context
await agentManager.injectContext(engineerId, 
  "Critical security vulnerability discovered in dependencies"
);

// Resume and watch how the conversation changes
await scenarioEngine.resume(scenarioId);
```

### Creating Timeline Branches

```javascript
// Create a branch to explore alternatives
const branch = await timeline.createBranch(scenarioId, Date.now());

// Now you have two timelines running in parallel!
```
