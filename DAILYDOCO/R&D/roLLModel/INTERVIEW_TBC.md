# roLLModels: Systematic Requirements Clarification Interview Framework

## **Meta-Interview Architecture**

### **Interview Methodology Philosophy**
This framework employs a **modular intelligence approach** to requirements gathering, designed for systematic, incremental clarification while maintaining maximum adaptability and precision. Each question module can be independently addressed, skipped, or revisited based on evolving understanding.

### **Interview Session Rules**
- **Question Cadence**: Maximum 1-2 questions per session
- **Skip Flexibility**: Any question can be deferred for later consideration
- **Integration Protocol**: Answers automatically integrated into project architecture
- **Iterative Refinement**: Previous answers can be revisited and updated
- **Context Preservation**: All responses maintained with full contextual linkage
