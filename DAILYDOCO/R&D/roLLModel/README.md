# roLLModels: Advanced Development Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview

**Mission**: Build the "GitHub Copilot for documentation" - an elite-tier automated documentation platform that captures, analyzes, and transforms developer workflows into professional video documentation through intelligent omnipresent logging and AI-powered content generation.

## Core Architecture Philosophy

### **Systematic Intelligence Framework**
- **Omnipresent Logging**: 24/7 background capture of all development activities
- **Modular Processing**: Bun + Rust hybrid architecture for optimal performance
- **Privacy-First Design**: Local processing with granular sensitive content filtering
- **Multi-Project Intelligence**: Simultaneous project context management
- **Autonomous Content Generation**: AI-powered narrative structure assembly

### **Technical Foundation**
- **Runtime**: Bun for business logic, Rust for performance-critical operations
- **Architecture**: Plugin-based modular system with message-passing IPC
- **Storage**: Local Graphiti knowledge graph + encrypted video storage
- **Interface**: Invisible system tray operation with comprehensive GUI dashboard
- **Integration**: Cross-platform IDE plugins and developer tool ecosystem

## Key Differentiators

| **Aspect** | **roLLModels Advantage** |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **Intelligence** | Understands code intent, not just screen capture |
| **Privacy** | Complete local processing with optional cloud sync |
| **Automation** | 98% automated with intelligent episode boundary detection |
| **Quality** | Broadcast-ready content requiring zero manual editing |
| **Context** | Multi-project correlation and cross-pattern recognition |

## Current Status

- **Phase**: R&D Architecture Planning
- **Focus**: Technical architecture design and clarification interview process
- **Next Steps**: Systematic requirements gathering through structured interview framework

## Development Approach

**Modular Intelligence Design**: Each component designed as reusable, adaptable module with clear interfaces and systematic upgrade paths. Focus on foundational architectures that can be reconfigured as requirements evolve.

**Systematic Requirements Gathering**: Structured interview process to clarify architectural decisions before implementation, ensuring optimal technical choices.
