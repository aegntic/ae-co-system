## 📝 DETAILED SCRIPT

### HOOK (0:00 - 0:30) 
**[Visual: Split screen showing code editor + DailyDoco interface]**

**Narration**: 
> "What if I told you this entire video was created automatically while I coded? I'm about to build a complete SaaS landing page in under 10 minutes, and DailyDoco Pro will document every keystroke, every decision, and even generate this narration you're hearing right now. It's DailyDoco all the way down."

**[Visual: Zoom into DailyDoco recording interface starting]**

> "Stay until the end - the result will blow your mind."

**Key Visual Elements**:
- Clean, professional setup
- DailyDoco logo prominently displayed
- Recording indicator shows active capture
- Multiple windows arranged perfectly

### PROBLEM SETUP (0:30 - 2:00)
**[Visual: Montage of traditional documentation problems]**

**Narration**:
> "Every developer knows this pain. You build something incredible - maybe it's a new feature, a tool, or an entire application. You're in the zone, code is flowing, everything works perfectly."

**[Visual: Show typical developer workflow - coding, testing, deploying]**

> "But then... the dreaded question: 'Where's the documentation?' And you think, 'I'll do it later.' Spoiler alert: later never comes."

**[Visual: Empty README files, confused users, support tickets]**

> "The result? Users get confused, adoption suffers, your brilliant work gets forgotten. According to GitHub, 40% of developers spend 4+ hours per week on documentation. That's 200 hours per year - an entire month of your life."

**[Visual: Statistics overlay, developer productivity charts]**

> "What if there was a way to document automatically, in real-time, while you work? What if your computer could understand what you're building and explain it better than you could?"

**[Visual: Transition to DailyDoco Pro starting up]**
