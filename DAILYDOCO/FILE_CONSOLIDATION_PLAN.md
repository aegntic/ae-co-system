# File Consolidation Plan

## Current Situation
We have 13 task/plan files with overlapping content. This creates confusion and maintenance overhead.

## Files to Keep (Primary Documents)
1. **TASKS.md** - Main task tracking file (most recent: Jun 16 13:20)
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - Detailed $100B implementation plan
3. **100B_INFRASTRUCTURE_REPORT.md** - Current validation status

## Files to Archive
These files contain historical information but are superseded by newer versions:

### Old Task Files
- TASKS_OLD_BACKUP.md (84KB - largest, contains historical tasks)
- TASKS_BEFORE_AFTER_COMPARISON.md (comparison document)
- TASKS_NEW_100B_STANDARDS.md (superseded by current TASKS.md)
- TASKS_ENHANCED_WITH_WEBSITE_EXTENSION.md (integrated into TASKS.md)
- TASKS_WEBSITE_EXTENSION_PROCESS.md (process documentation)

### Old Planning Files  
- PLANNING.md (original planning, superseded by IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
- ULTRAPLAN.md (early planning version)
- ULTRAPLAN-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md (summary of old plan)
- ULTRAPLAN-EXECUTION-SEQUENCE.md (integrated into roadmap)
- ULTRAPLAN_100B_TRANSFORMATION.md (superseded by roadmap)
- ULTRAPLAN_WEBSITE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md (specific infrastructure plan)
- ULTRAPLAN_GIT_ADD.md (git-specific planning)

## Proposed Action
1. Create an `archive/` directory
2. Move all superseded files to archive with timestamps
3. Keep only the 3 primary documents in root
4. Create a CHANGELOG.md to track major changes

## Benefits
- Clear single source of truth
- Reduced confusion
- Historical data preserved in archive
- Easier navigation and maintenance
