## What I'm Looking For

I'm interested in opportunities where I can contribute to fundamental challenges in AI development, particularly around:

- **Human-AI collaboration patterns** that maintain user agency while leveraging AI capabilities
- **Performance optimization** for AI systems that need to work in real-world production environments  
- **Integration challenges** between multiple AI models and existing development workflows
- **Privacy and security** considerations as AI becomes more integrated into sensitive workflows

I'm drawn to teams that are building foundational technology rather than just applying existing solutions, and where technical excellence and user value are equally important.

## Personal Interests

When not building AI systems, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, contributing to open source projects, and learning from the developer community. I believe the best technology solutions come from understanding real user problems and iterating based on actual usage patterns.

I'm also fascinated by the philosophical implications of AI development and how we can build systems that amplify human creativity rather than replace it.
