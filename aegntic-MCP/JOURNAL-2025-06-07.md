## MCP Server Troubleshooting Session

### Issue
User reported failures with MCP commands "quick-data" and "colab", specifically mentioning that `ai-collaboration-hub` and other servers were still failing after initial attempts to fix them.

### Initial State
- Main MCP server running on port 9100 with Sesame CSM initialization errors
- Multiple MCP servers running in background (memory, filesystem, docker, sequential-thinking, etc.)
- `ai-collaboration-hub` server not accessible through MCP system

### Root Cause Analysis
Through sequential thinking process, identified that:
1. `ai-collaboration-hub` server requires OpenRouter API key via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Server code was functional but missing from Claude Code's main MCP configuration
3. Local config file existed at `/home/tabs/aegntic-MCP/servers/ai-collaboration-hub/claude-code-config.json` but wasn't being used by Claude Code system

### Solution Steps

#### 1. API Key Configuration
- User provided OpenRouter API key: `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`
- Verified server functionality by running directly with inline environment variable:
  ```bash
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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 uv run python -m ai_collaboration_hub.server
  ```
- Server successfully initialized: "ðŸš€ AI Collaboration Hub initialized"

#### 2. MCP Configuration Fix
- Located main Claude Code configuration: `/home/tabs/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Added missing `ai-collaboration-hub` server configuration:
  ```json
  "ai-collaboration-hub": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "ai_collaboration_hub.server"],
    "cwd": "/home/tabs/aegntic-MCP/servers/ai-collaboration-hub",
    "env": {
      "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "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"
    }
  }
  ```

### Technical Details
- **Working Directory**: `/home/tabs/aegntic-MCP/servers/ai-collaboration-hub`
- **Server Module**: `ai_collaboration_hub.server`
- **Package Manager**: `uv` (modern Python package management)
- **Environment**: OpenRouter API key required for Gemini collaboration features

### Current Status
- Configuration updated in main Claude desktop config
- Server tested and confirmed working when run directly
- Pending: Claude Code restart to load new configuration

### Next Steps
1. Check for other active Claude Code instances to avoid interruption
2. Restart only this Claude Code instance if safe to do so
3. Verify `ai-collaboration-hub` server is accessible through MCP system
4. Test "colab" and other collaboration features

### Notes
- `ai-collaboration-hub` enables supervised bidirectional AI communication between Claude Code and Gemini
- Uses OpenRouter's free tier ($5 free credits)
- Features 1M token context window for comprehensive code analysis
- Includes user approval gates for controlled AI-to-AI collaboration
