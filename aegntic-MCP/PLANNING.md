## Project Scope

AegnticMCP aims to provide a comprehensive solution for generating and managing MCP servers dynamically. The project will focus on:

- Automating MCP server creation using structured prompts.
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility through Docker and a RESTful API.
- Implementing AI-driven agents for monitoring and optimization.
- Integrating advanced features like voice synthesis and media processing.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Web apps, mobile apps, browser extensions, VSCode plugins.
- **Backend**: Node.js-based MCP servers running in Docker containers.
- **Automation**: n8n for workflow orchestration.
- **AI Integration**: Sesame CSM for voice synthesis, OpenRouter for LLMs.
- **Media Processing**: FFmpeg for video and image generation.

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), Python (for AI models)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Automation**: n8n
- **Voice Synthesis**: Sesame CSM
- **LLMs**: OpenRouter (free models like DeepSeek-V3-0324, Llama 3.3)
- **Media Tools**: FFmpeg, scrot

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Foundation**
   - Set up the MCP server template.
   - Integrate Docker for deployment.
   - Implement basic n8n workflows for monitoring.

2. **Phase 2: Automation and Integration**
   - Enhance n8n workflows for dynamic MCP server creation.
   - Integrate Sesame CSM for voice synthesis.
   - Set up media processing pipelines using FFmpeg.

3. **Phase 3: AI-Driven Enhancements**
   - Implement AI agents for error prediction and resolution.
   - Optimize workflows using self-learning mechanisms.
   - Integrate 3D visualization for workflow management.

## Milestones and Timelines

- **Milestone 1**: Complete Phase 1 by April 15, 2025.
- **Milestone 2**: Complete Phase 2 by May 15, 2025.
- **Milestone 3**: Complete Phase 3 by June 15, 2025.

## Error Handling and Ambiguity Resolution

The system will implement an interactive clarification approach:

- **Chatbot Interface**: When encountering vague instructions or unclear content, a conversational interface will engage with the user
- **Targeted Questions**: The system will ask specific questions to resolve ambiguities
- **Contextual Awareness**: Questions will reference the specific part of the process needing clarification
- **Learning System**: Over time, the system could learn from previous clarifications to reduce the need for questions

## Security and Privacy Approach

Given the personal-use focus of the initial development:

- **Basic Security**: Implement standard security practices for personal applications
- **Local Data Storage**: Prioritize local storage of sensitive information where possible
- **Authentication**: Simple authentication for web interfaces
- **Scalable Foundation**: Design with a structure that could accommodate more robust security if the project expands beyond personal use in the future

## Connectivity Considerations

The project will need to explore the balance between online and offline functionality:

- **Online Processing**: Leveraging cloud-based AI services and tools will require internet connectivity for certain operations
- **Offline Capabilities**: Investigating possibilities for downloading and processing content locally when appropriate
- **Hybrid Approach**: Potential for a system that can queue tasks when offline and process them when connectivity is restored
- **Requirements Exploration**: Further investigation needed to determine the optimal balance based on technical constraints and user needs

## User Interface Approach

The system will prioritize functionality and user experience through a multi-faceted interface approach:

1. **Desktop Application**: Core processing engine and local workflow management, allowing for processing without constant internet connection.
2. **Browser Extension**: For seamless integration, content capture, and easy triggering of workflows.
3. **Web Interface**: For cross-device access to review progress, make edits, and manage projects from any device.
