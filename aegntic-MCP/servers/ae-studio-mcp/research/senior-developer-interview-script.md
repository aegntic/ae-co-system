## Pre-Interview Setup (5 minutes)

### Interviewer Checklist:
- [ ] Recording permission obtained
- [ ] Portfolio/GitHub reviewed
- [ ] Current role and company researched
- [ ] Animation examples from their work identified

### Introduction Script:
```
Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time today. I'm Mattae Cooper from AEGNTIC Foundation. 

We're researching frontend animation workflows to build better AI-powered development tools. Your insights will directly shape what we build.

This is purely research - no sales pitch. I'd love to understand your real-world experiences with animation development.

Mind if I record this for analysis? Audio only, just for internal research.

Any questions before we dive in?
```
